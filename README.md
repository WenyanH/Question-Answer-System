1. I have uploaded four wiki raw files we once used for our questions asking & answering in txt format.

2. The wikiPretreament.py is used for pretreatment the wiki file into an operable txt file for your further steps.
It is in the command line format for your file input and output.

3. I tried to fetch the main information from the website directly but haven't found a good way for the data cleaning. Now the code is in the txtFetch.py.
It would be better if you could give me some advice. Or, need we complete this function?
