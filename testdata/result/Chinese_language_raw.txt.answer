Possible sentences:

There are also sizable Hakka and Shanghainese diasporas , for example in Taiwan , where most Hakka communities are also conversant in Taiwanese and Standard Chinese .

Southern Chinese varieties like Cantonese and Hakka preserved more of the rimes of Middle Chinese and also have more tones .

For example , in addition to putonghua , a resident of Shanghai might speak Shanghainese ; and , if he or she grew up elsewhere , then he or she may also be likely to be fluent in the particular dialect of that local area .

Answering:Are Chinese characters morphemes independent of phonetic change ?


[0.20963283889640047, 0.10329571947847027, 0.07244227515603349]
Possible sentences:

Chinese characters are morphemes independent of phonetic change .

In 100 CE , the famed Han dynasty scholar Xu Shen classified characters into six categories , namely pictographs , simple ideographs , compound ideographs , phonetic loans , phonetic compounds and derivative characters .

Scholars have attempted to reconstruct the phonology of Old Chinese by comparing later varieties of Chinese with the rhyming practice of the Classic of Poetry and the phonetic elements found in the majority of Chinese characters .

[0.3834527200301807, 0.07262628600974241, 0.06867974408970293]
Possible sentences:

Jerry Norman called this practice misleading , pointing out that Wu , which itself contains many mutually unintelligible varieties , could not be properly called a single language under the same criterion , and that the same is true for each of the other groups .

Conventional English - language usage in Chinese linguistics is to use dialect for the speech of a particular place ( regardless of status ) while regional groupings like Mandarin and Wu are called dialect groups .

Putonghua/Guoyu , often called " Mandarin " , is the official standard language used by the People 's Republic of China , the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) , and Singapore ( where it is called " Huayu " or simply Chinese ) .

Answering:What is spoken by the Han majority and many other ethnic groups in China ?


[0.3010709347240574, 0.11504893293272964, 0.11234691947338059]
Possible sentences:

Chinese is spoken by the Han majority and many other ethnic groups in China .

There are between 7 and 13 main regional groups of Chinese ( depending on classification scheme ) , of which the most spoken by far is Mandarin ( about 960 million ) , followed by Wu ( 80 million ) , Yue ( 60 million ) and Min ( 70 million ) .

John DeFrancis considers the mutual unintelligibility too great for the term " dialects " to be used to refer to the different varieties , but also objects to considering them as separate languages , as it incorrectly implies a set of disruptive " religious , economic , political , and other differences " between speakers that exist , for example , between French Catholics and English Protestants in Canada , but not between speakers of Cantonese and Mandarin in China , owing to China 's near - uninterrupted history of centralized government .

Possible sentences:

Scholars from different lands could communicate , albeit only in writing , using Literary Chinese .

Although many of the finer details remain unclear , most scholars agree that Old Chinese differed from Middle Chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial consonant clusters of some sort , and in having voiceless nasals and liquids .

Because varieties from different groups are not mutually intelligible , some scholars prefer to describe Wu and so on as languages .
