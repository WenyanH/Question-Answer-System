Answering:Are the varieties of Chinese usually described by native speakers as dialects of a single Chinese language , but linguists note that they are as diverse as a language family ?


[0.6124654707215837, 0.23770081186793676, 0.23209720088580668]
Possible sentences:

The varieties of Chinese are usually described by native speakers as dialects of a single Chinese language , but linguists note that they are as diverse as a language family .

John DeFrancis considers the mutual unintelligibility too great for the term " dialects " to be used to refer to the different varieties , but also objects to considering them as separate languages , as it incorrectly implies a set of disruptive " religious , economic , political , and other differences " between speakers that exist , for example , between French Catholics and English Protestants in Canada , but not between speakers of Cantonese and Mandarin in China , owing to China 's near - uninterrupted history of centralized government .

Mutual intelligibility is considered by some linguists to be the main criterion for determining whether varieties are separate languages or dialects of a single language , although others do not regard it as decisive , particularly when cultural factors interfere as they do with Chinese .

Answering:Are most of these groups mutually unintelligible , although some , like Xiang and the Southwest Mandarin dialects , may share common terms and some degree of intelligibility ?


[0.6594966984382618, 0.2194063828373123, 0.1668567960854292]
Possible sentences:

Most of these groups are mutually unintelligible , although some , like Xiang and the Southwest Mandarin dialects , may share common terms and some degree of intelligibility .

As Campbell ( 2008 ) explains , linguists often ignore mutual intelligibility when varieties share intelligibility with a central variety ( i.e. prestige variety , such as Standard Mandarin ) , as the issue requires some careful handling when mutual intelligibility is inconsistent with language identity .

As a result , these terms are virtually indistinguishable from native Chinese words : indeed , there is some dispute over some of these terms as to whether the Japanese or Chinese coined them first .
